# Malware Prediction Project

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict potential malware threats by analyzing historical threat data and software behavior patterns. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that enable organizations to proactively protect their systems against security risks. The project includes detailed reports on potential threats and prediction accuracy, empowering cybersecurity teams to enhance their defensive strategies.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and analysis of data to identify malware trends.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalizing, and encoding data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning models to predict malware threats.
- **MLFlow Integration:** Experiment tracking and model management using MLFlow.
- **Deployment:** Integration of the model into a Flask application, providing RESTful endpoints for predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssef-223/Malware-Prediction-Project.git
   cd Malware-Prediction-Project
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Use Postman or any other API client to interact with the endpoints:
   . Endpoint for predictions: `http://localhost:5000/predict`
